#### mistakes
I misunderstood “random” as defining a function and placed it in the setup section, so the drawn pattern could not be displayed initially.
then I found it in the week 03 repo on the Internet
so correct it

#### drawing concept
use the grid but draw around the grid by random

# questions (update got it!)
but I found that if I want to random choose 1 of 3, it doesn't work with "random(5,10,20)"? "random(5,10,20)" works the same as random(5,10)?

use "if" to control the possibility
